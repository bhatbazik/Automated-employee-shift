## how the generate schedule works
1. Extract Input Parameters:
The function receives a startDate and endDate in the request body, which represent the period for which the schedule needs to be generated.
2. Fetch Data:
It fetches a list of all employees (with the role employee) from the database.
It fetches the employees' availability (i.e., which shifts they are available for) within the given date range (from startDate to endDate).
3. Initialize Data:
shiftCounts: This will track how many shifts each employee has already been assigned.
employeeLastShiftEnd: This keeps track of when the employee's last shift ended (used to enforce a break between shifts).
An empty array shifts is initialized to store the created shifts.
4. Loop Through Dates:
The function uses a while loop to go through each date in the range from startDate to endDate.
5. Loop Through Shift Types:
For each date, it considers 3 types of shifts: morning, afternoon, and night.
6. Calculate Shift Times:
For each shift type (morning, afternoon, night), the function calculates the start and end times using the helper function getShiftTimes.
7. Filter Available Employees:
It filters employees who are available for the shift type on that date by checking their availability against the database.
Employees must have marked that shift type as available for that day.
8. Check Maximum Shift Limits:
It filters out employees who have already reached their maximum allowed shifts. This is calculated based on their maximum working hours (e.g., 40 hours/week).
It calculates the maximum shifts an employee can work based on their max hours, assuming each shift is 8 hours.
9. Enforce Minimum Rest Period:
For fairness, the function ensures that employees have at least a 12-hour gap between their last shift end time and the new shift start time. This is enforced by filtering out employees who do not meet this rest period.
10. Shuffle and Sort Employees:
The available employees are shuffled randomly to avoid any bias in the order of selection.
Then, it sorts them by how many shifts they have been assigned to so far. Employees with fewer shifts are prioritized to ensure fairness.
11. Ensure at Least One Senior Employee:
The function ensures that at least one senior employee is included in each shift. If a senior employee is available, they are selected for the shift.
If no senior employee is available, a notification is sent to the employees about this.
12. Limit Maximum Employees Per Shift:
For each shift type, there is a maximum number of employees allowed (e.g., 3 employees per shift). The function picks employees from the filtered list until this limit is reached.
13. Update Shift Assignments:
After selecting employees for the shift, the function updates:
The shiftCounts for each assigned employee (to track how many shifts they have).
The employeeLastShiftEnd to track when the employee's last shift ends.
14. Create the Shift:
If the minimum number of employees (e.g., 1 employee) is met for the shift, it creates a new shift in the database with:
The selected employees.
The shift's date, type, and other properties (e.g., minEmployees, maxEmployees).
The shift is then added to the shifts array.
15. Move to Next Day:
The loop moves to the next day and repeats the process for the entire date range.
16. Return Response:
After generating all the shifts, the function sends a response with a list of all the created shifts.
17. Error Handling:
If any error occurs during the process (e.g., database issues, invalid data), the function returns an error message with a 500 status code.
  ## requirements met
  Automated Shift Scheduling System

  
Senior Employee Inclusion: Ensures at least one senior employee is assigned to each shift.
Shift Time Constraints: Prevents employees from working consecutive shifts longer than 8 hours and enforces a 12-hour gap between shifts.
Weekly Shift Limit: Employees are capped at 5 shifts per week.
Max Shift Capacity: The system ensures shifts are fully staffed without exceeding the maximum number of employees per shift.
Fair Distribution: The system distributes shifts fairly, preventing employees from being overburdened with undesirable shifts (e.g., all night shifts).

Dynamic Adjustments

Update Handling: If employees change availability (shift preferences, max hours, days off), the system recalculates and adjusts shifts accordingly.
No Unfilled Shifts: The system ensures shifts are filled without violating constraints.
Notifications: Employees are notified when their preferences can't be fully met.
This setup ensures efficient, fair, and dynamic scheduling, with system constraints properly enforced.
